    C              G
The snow is coming faster
    C              G
My view ‘round the bend
    C       G
A beautiful valley 
              D
Tucked into a glen

 
    C         G
Can barely be seen 
                 B
But where is the wind?   
         Am
Where is noise? 
          C         Am
Where are voices again?


C           G         
Locked in a capsule
    C            G
For time without end
C            G
Watching the world 
       D
From a pane or a lense


C                 G		
There’s nothing to fear	
             B
When there’s nobody near  
              Am
But silence can kill 
                       C   Am
And there’s lots of it here


C             G
We decided to part
                B
Each make a new start 
             Am
But I didn’t know


           C               G
What you’d take when you’d go
        B
Now I’m beholden
               Am
To Silence not golden
                  C   Am             
There’s nothing to say
                  C 
When the words go away

	
   C         G
Embraced isolation
     C       G
It’s never a choice
  C            G
I long for the comfort 
                D
I get from your voice


    C         G
The vacuum of sound
                     B
That you leave When you go
                  Am
Is spreading the silence
               C   Am 
Around us like snow


   C          G
We decided to part
             B
Each make a new start 
             Am   
But I didn’t know

           C              G
What you’d take when you’d go
             B
Now I’m beholden
               Am  
To silence not golden
                   C  Am
There’s nothing to say

                  C       G
When the words go away
                  C       G
When the words go away
                  C       G
When the words go away 
                  C       G
When the words go away
